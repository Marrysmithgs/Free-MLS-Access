# Free MLS Access
Though the multiple listing service (MLS) is a key part of any traditional home buying experience and requires a real estate license to access, it is often overlooked in the real estate investing process.

Examples of the data available include building permits, owner and buyers, current and past sales figures, parcels, assessed values and property taxes. So now you know how to [Free MLS Access](https://216sold.io/).
The first and best way to access the MLS is to become an agent. This will grant you full rights as a member and once you get your license, approval for the MLS is a formality.
If you do not have the time or money to become an agent yourself, you may consider bringing on an agent as a partner in your venture. The MLS will still need to approve everyone who has access, but having an agent on your team may increase your chances.
